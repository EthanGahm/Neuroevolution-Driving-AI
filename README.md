# Neuroevolution-Driving-AI
A basic, neuroevolution-based driving simulator written in Processing.

The code in this repository was written in February of 2020. The algorithm employs a fixed-size neural network with genetically-inherited weights. Indivuals attempt to navigate a track without colliding with walls. Fitness is determined based on the number of invisible checkpoints reached along the length of the track.

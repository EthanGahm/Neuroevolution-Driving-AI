# Neuroevolution-Driving-AI
A basic, neuroevolution-based driving simulator written in Processing.

The code in this repository was written in February of 2020. The algorithm employs a fixed-size neural network with genetically-inherited weights. Indivuals' fitness is determined by the number of invisible checkpoints reached on a "track" as they attempt to drive around it.
